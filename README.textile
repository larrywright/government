These are wrappers for some of the various apis that expose government information. 

They are created using "HTTParty":http://httparty.rubyforge.org/, which is awesome.

h1. GOP

This API is flaky, to say the least. The method calls don't work consistently.

h1. New York Times

New York Times has a congressional API. It's documented here: http://developer.nytimes.com/docs/congress_api

These wrappers are not complete, the New York Times one in particular really needs to have a cleaner API rather than just mapping directly to the API methods.

These wrappers stem from a blog post I wrote on the topic of government data exposed via web services: http://larrywright.me/blog/articles/213-towards-a-more-open-government
